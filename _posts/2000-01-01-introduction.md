Each year, an estimated two million Americans receive a cancer diagnosis. Patient characteristics such as age, gender, and general health status can impact cancer progression and response to treatment modalities like chemotherapy. Nonetheless, a crucial yet often overlooked element that may hold significant sway is the patient's microbiome. While humans possess approximately 20,000 genes in our DNA, we also harbor a substantial number of microbial genes, ranging from 2 to 20 million throughout our various bodily microbiomes.

Furthermore, despite a 99.99% DNA similarity between two strangers, their gut microbiomes may only share 10% similarity. In numerous instances, the microbiome composition dictates medication efficacy and disease susceptibility. Consequently, it is plausible that mycobiomes might partly contribute to the differential cancer progression rates observed in some individuals.
